ESPHome three speed fan adaptation

These are the files needed for my ESPHome three speed fan project.
The project was to take a three speed pedestal fan and adapt it to be ´smart´ with control via Home Assistant.
The fan is a typical pedestal fan with the three speeds being set by where the power is applied on the coil.

For more details of how to use the files here, see the project on Instructables, here:
